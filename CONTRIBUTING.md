It's easy to up and running project using `vscode` `devcontainer`. Clone repository and open it with `Visual Studio Code` then open project with `Dev Container`.
It will give you `Python 3.6.x` and `pip`, So open terminal and run following command:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
now you can run the script with:
```sh
python bot.py 
```
